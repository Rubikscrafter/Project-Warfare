<h2>Project NoName: iFlaimar, AceEffort, Devoid of Rubikscrafter, moldotron and DeltaV
<p>We are a group of highschoolers who decided to learn programming, 
with a variety of reasoning ranging from the desire to learn, to the desire to make a game.
Due to our awareness that the internet can be a dangerous place, we will not be disclosing our name, nor will we be disclosing where we live.
