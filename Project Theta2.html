<h1> Team ?Theta2? W.I.P. website </h1>

<h2> Brought to you by: Joseph Middleton, Danilo Montes, David Ovetsky, Hayagriv Gopinath and Andrew Abbate </h2>

<p>  This is the official website of Team ?Theta2?, where users will be able to find links to our projects.    </p>
<p>     This will probably look good to colleges, if we can make a usable website about us with information. We can low-key make it part

     of our resume. Also gonna look nice if we apply to jobs or internships somewhere. </p>
